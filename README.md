Description
-----------

This is a simple game for mobile devices. In this game you are a turtle that has to shield from falling metorites. You have two shields (one blue and one red), and you have to deflect the metorites of the same color. If you deflect a meteorite with the wrong shield the game ends, and a score is shown (the number of meteorites deflected).
The meteorites fall really fast, but that is the fun of the game ;)

How to try it
-------------
Well, you can download from a store and rate it, or you can download the whole project from GitHub and open index.html with your explorer (tested in Chrome and Firefox).
